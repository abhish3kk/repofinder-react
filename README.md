## Introduction

### What is Repofinder?

Repofinder is a React application that helps users discover GitHub repositories efficiently. It interacts with the GitHub API via a Node.js Express backend, allowing users to search for repositories based on customizable parameters such as **topics, programming language, star count, result limit, sorting criteria,** and more. Users can configure these filters in the **Settings** section to refine their search and find repositories that align with their interests.

### Features

- **Search Repositories by Topic & Language** – Easily filter repositories based on relevant technologies and domains.
- **Find Active & Relevant Projects** – Avoid outdated or inactive repositories by prioritizing projects with recent activity.
- **Sort by Stars & Popularity** – Discover trending repositories based on their star count and engagement.
- **Reduce Overwhelm** – Many top-ranked repositories can be complex or inactive. Repofinder helps users find projects that are easier to contribute to based on recent activity and stack relevance.

## Application Architecture

### Overview

Repofinder follows a **client-server architecture**, where the frontend (React) communicates with the backend (Node.js + Express) to fetch repositories via the GitHub API. The application ensures seamless user authentication, state management, and API communication to provide an interactive user experience.

    ReactApp -->|API Calls| NodeBackend;

```

> The diagram above represents the data flow: Users interact with the React frontend, which fetches data from the backend, and the backend queries the GitHub API before returning the results to the client.

### Component Breakdown

```
src/components
├── Card.tsx
├── Combobox.tsx
├── Darklight.tsx
├── Error.tsx
├── Loader.tsx
├── MainContent.tsx
├── Nav.tsx
└── UserDropdown.tsx
```

The application consists of various reusable and structural components, categorized as follows:

#### **Core UI Components**

- **Card.tsx** – Displays repository details such as name, stars, and description.
- **Combobox.tsx** – A searchable dropdown component for selecting options like topics or languages.
- **Darklight.tsx** – Toggles between dark and light themes.
- **Error.tsx** – Displays error messages when API calls fail or when the backend is unreachable.
- **Loader.tsx** – A loading spinner shown during API calls or page transitions.

#### **Structural Components**

- **MainContent.tsx** – The primary layout container that renders content dynamically.
- **Nav.tsx** – The navigation bar containing links and user profile actions.
- **UserDropdown.tsx** – A headless component for user-related actions like logout and profile settings.

### State Management

Repofinder uses a combination of **Zustand** and **Context API** for efficient state management:

#### **Global State Management with Zustand**

Zustand is used for managing application-wide state while ensuring minimal re-renders. The following stores handle different aspects of the app:

```
src/store
├── appStore.ts
├── authStore.ts
├── index.ts
└── settingStore.ts
```

- **`appStore.ts`** – Manages global app settings like theme selection (dark/light mode).
- **`authStore.ts`** – Stores authentication details, including user session and JWT tokens.
- **`settingStore.ts`** – Maintains user-defined search filters (topics, language, stars, etc.).

#### **Context API for UI State**

Context API is used for handling UI-related transient states that don’t require persistence, such as:

- **Loader State** – Controls when to show/hide the loader during API requests and page transitions.

By combining **Zustand** for persistent, app-wide state and **Context API** for temporary UI state, Repofinder ensures a smooth and optimized user experience.
